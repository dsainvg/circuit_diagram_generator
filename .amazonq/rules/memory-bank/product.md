# Circuit Diagram Generator - Product Overview

## Purpose and Value Proposition
The Circuit Diagram Generator is a specialized tool for creating visual SVG circuit diagrams from CSV data files. It transforms textual circuit descriptions into professional-quality schematic diagrams, making it invaluable for electrical engineering education, documentation, and circuit design visualization.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Core Functionality
- **CSV-to-SVG Conversion**: Converts circuit definitions from structured CSV files into scalable vector graphics
- **Modular Architecture**: Separates concerns across data loading, symbol management, layout calculation, and SVG rendering
- **Comprehensive IC Support**: Supports common 74-series and 4000-series logic ICs with accurate pin mappings
- **Intelligent Layout**: Automatically positions chips and calculates optimal canvas dimensions
- **Professional Output**: Generates clean, readable circuit diagrams with proper gate symbols

### Supported Gate Types
- Logic Gates: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, NXOR (2, 3, 4 inputs)
- Inverters: NOT gates and buffers
- Visual Elements: LED outputs for circuit endpoints
- IC Packages: 14-pin and 16-pin DIP packages with accurate pinouts

### Input/Output Management
- **Input Handling**: Supports labeled circuit inputs with visual input boxes
- **Output Visualization**: Creates output boxes with LED indicators
- **Connection Mapping**: Traces signal paths between chips, inputs, and outputs
- **Pin-accurate Routing**: Maintains electrical accuracy with proper pin assignments
