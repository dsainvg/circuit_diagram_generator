# Circuit Diagram Generator - Product Overview

## Purpose and Value Proposition
The Circuit Diagram Generator is a specialized tool that automatically creates professional circuit diagrams from CSV data files. It transforms textual circuit descriptions into visual SVG diagrams, making circuit design documentation faster and more consistent than manual drawing tools.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Core Functionality
- **CSV-to-SVG Conversion**: Converts chip definitions and connections from CSV files into professional circuit diagrams
- **Modular Architecture**: Separates data loading, layout management, rendering, and routing into distinct components
- **Intelligent Layout**: Automatically positions chips and routes connections using advanced channel routing algorithms
- **Symbol Library**: Comprehensive collection of logic gate symbols (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, NOT, XOR, NXOR) in multiple input configurations

### Advanced Features
- **Channel Routing**: Sophisticated wire routing system with multiple fallback strategies for complex connections
- **IC Chip Support**: Built-in support for common 74xx series logic chips with proper pin mappings
- **Custom IC Integration**: Support for custom IC chips with IC8, IC14, IC16 package types
- **Input/Output Management**: Dedicated input and output boxes for external circuit connections
- **Display Module Support**: 7-segment display integration for visual output representation
- **Scalable Canvas**: Dynamic canvas sizing based on circuit complexity
- **Datasheet Integration**: Uses chip datasheet data for accurate pin configurations and gate arrangements

### Output Capabilities
- **SVG Generation**: Creates scalable vector graphics for high-quality diagrams
- **PNG Export**: Converts SVG to PNG format for documentation and presentations
- **Professional Styling**: Clean, technical drawing style suitable for engineering documentation
- **Multi-format Support**: Flexible output directory structure with archival capabilities
